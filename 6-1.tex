\section*{6/1}
  Assume that you have two independent Poisson process $N_1(t)$ with rate
  $\lambda_1$ and $N_2(t)$ with rate $\lambda_2$. What is the probability that
  $n$ events occur in the first process before $m$ events occur in the 2nd
  process.\\

  \noindent \underline{Example}: $\lambda_1 = 5$, $\lambda_2 = 1$, $n = 5$,
  $m = 2$.\\
  Let $T_i^1$ be the interarrival times for the 1st process.\\
  Let $T_i^2$ be the interarrival times for the 2nd process.\\
  Let $S_n^1 = T_1^1 + \ldots T_n^1$\\
  Let $S_m^2 = T_1^2 + \ldots T_m^2$\\
  Start with a continued Poisson process with $\lambda_1 + \lambda_2$, then
  independently decide for each event whether it belongs to the 1st process
  with probability $\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}$ or the 2nd process
  with probability $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}$. The obtained 
  processes are independent and have the correct rates.\\

  \begin{eqnarray*}
    P(S_n^1 < S_m^1) & = & P(\text{among first $m + n -1$ events (in the 
      combined process), $n$ or more events belong to the 1st process})\\
      & = & \sum_{k = n}^{n + m -1} \binom{n + m -1}{k} \left(\frac{\lambda_1}
      {\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)^k 
      \left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2}\right)^{n + m - 1 - k}\\
      & = & \sum_{k = 5}^6 \binom{6}{k} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^k\left(\frac
        {1}{6}\right)^{6 - k}\\
      & = & \frac{11 \cdot 5^5}{6^6}
  \end{eqnarray*}
  If you change $m = 1$, then our answer is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^5$\\

  \noindent \underline{Example}: You have 3 friends, $A, B, C$. Each will call
    you on exponential amount of time with $exp(30min), exp(1hr), exp(2.5hr)$
    respectively. You will go out with the first one that calls. What is
    the probability that you go out with $A$?\\

  \noindent Intepret each call as the first event in a Poisson process (rates
    $2, 1, \frac{5}{2}$ (the units are an hour)). Note that rates are inverses
    of your mean.\\

  \noindent Let the rates be $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ respectively.\\
    Start with ($\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3$) Poisson process, distribute
    the events with probability $\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + 
    \lambda_3}$, $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}$, and
    $\frac{\lambda_3}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}$ respectively.\\
    Probability of A calling first is $\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 +
    \lambda_3} = \frac{2}{2 + 1 + \frac{5}{2}}$.\\

  \begin{theorem}
    Given that $N(t) = k$, the conditional distribution of the arrival times,
    $S_1, \ldots, S_k$, is distributed as order statistics of $k$ independent
    uniform variables: the set $\{ S_1, \ldots, S_k\} = \{U_1, \ldots, U_i\}$,
    where $U_i$ are iid uniform on $[0, t)$.\\
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{theorem}
    Given that $S_k = t$, $S_1, \ldots, S_{k - 1}$ are distributed as order 
    statistics of $k - 1$ uniform $(0, t)$ random variables.\\
  \end{theorem}
  \begin{proof}
    Why? $N$ independently coins with heads probability $p$. Condition on
    $k$ heads.\\
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      P(k \text{ heads occurs on specifics subset of $k$ coins} | \text{$k$ 
      heads}) & = & \text{same for all subsets of size $k$}\\
    \end{eqnarray*}
  \end{proof}

  \noindent \underline{Example}: Assume that passangers arrive as a Poisson
  process with rate $\lambda$.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The only bus departs after time $T$. Compute the expected combined 
      walking time, $W$ for all passangers.\\

      \noindent If $S_1, S_2, \ldots, $ are the arrival times in $[0, 1]$, then
      the combined waiting times, $T - S_1 + T - S_3 + \ldots$\\
      Let $N(t)$ be the number of arrivales in $[0, t]$.\\
      \begin{eqnarray*}
        E(W) & = & \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}E[W | N(T) = k] P(N(T) = k)\\
        & = & \sum_{k  = 0}^{\infty} \ldots
      \end{eqnarray*}
    \item now, two buses depart, are at $T$, one at $S < T$, $EW$
      
      \noindent $\lambda \frac{s^2}{2} + \lambda \frac{(T - S)^2}{2}$

    \item Now assume $T$(the only bus time) is $exponential(\mu)$, indpendent
    of the passengers.\\

      \noindent 
        \begin{eqnarray*}
          EW & = & E(W | T = t)E(T = t)\\
            & = & \int_0^{\infty} \lambda\frac{t^2}{2}f_T(t)dt\\
            & = & \frac{\lambda}{2} E(T^2)\\
            & = & \frac{\lambda}{2} (Var(T) + (ET)^2)\\
            & = & \frac{\lambda}{2} \frac{2}{\mu^2}\\
            & = & \frac{\lambda}{\mu^2}
        \end{eqnarray*}
    \item Two busses now arrive as first two events in a $poisson(\mu)$ process
    $EW = 2\frac{\lambda}{\mu^2}$
  \end{enumerate}
